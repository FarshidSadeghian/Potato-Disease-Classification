# Potato Leaf Disease Classification for Agricultural Applications

## Overview
This repository contains code for classifying potato leaf diseases using machine learning techniques. The model developed in this project has broad applications in agriculture, specifically in identifying and diagnosing diseases affecting potato plants. Accurate disease classification is crucial for early detection and timely intervention, ensuring a healthy crop yield.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found at the following link: [Plant Village Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village). The dataset comprises a diverse collection of images representing various plant diseases, including those affecting potatoes.

## Project Highlights
### Data Preprocessing
The dataset has been preprocessed to ensure consistency and enhance model performance. Preprocessing techniques include resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

### Model Architecture
The code implements a deep learning model, tailored for image classification tasks. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are utilized to effectively learn features from the images.

### Training and Evaluation
The model is trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated on a separate validation set to measure its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to assess the model's effectiveness.

### Deployment
The trained model can be deployed in real-world scenarios, such as agricultural farms or research institutions, to identify potato leaf diseases automatically.
